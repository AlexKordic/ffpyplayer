TODO:
* Implement CONFIG_SDL to be able to compile without needing SDL at all.
* Currently, it only supports text subtitles - bitmap subtitles are ignored.
  Unless one uses a filter to overlay the subtitle.
* We can not yet visualize audio to video. Provide a filter chain link between
  audio to video filters to acomplish this.
